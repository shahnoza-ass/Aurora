# AURORO - Pong Game and Whack-a-Mole Game

**AURORO** is a platform featuring two classic games: **Pong** and **Whack-a-Mole**. These games are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to experience retro games in a modern setting.

## Game Descriptions

- **Game Controls:**
  - **Up Arrow (↑)** – Move the player's paddle up.
  - **Down Arrow (↓)** – Move the player's paddle down.

### 2. **Whack-a-Mole Game**
